## Discussion

I used the following technologies: HTML, CSS, React, Express, axios, React Router.
I used [create-react-app](https://goo.gl/26jfy4)
to generate the scaffolding for this app.
I used as much semantic html as possible to ensure that the website is as accesible as possible. The user should be able to use the full application with just a keyboard.
I attempted to create a test in Login.test.js but was unable to resolve an issue at this moment.
